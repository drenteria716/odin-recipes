# odin-recipes
This project is mainly concerned with basic html and file structure. The assignment is to create a website that displays a few different recipe guides.
It was able to demonstrate the relevance and neccesity of Git, using commands to create and organize file structure. It involves hands on work with a repository, a code editor, a version processing software, and html syntax. The following element types were included in this project:
Main root, Document metadata, Sectioning root, Content sectioning, Text content, Inline text semantics, and image elements.
Through this I was able to create a basic webpage directory of files that establish relationship to eachother.
