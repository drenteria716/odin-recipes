    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>There is a reason so many people claim that chicken soup is good for the body and soul. Read onwards to investigate how plain chicken and vegatables simmered together can make a tasty meal. Thank you for visiting!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 (3 pound) whole chicken</li>
        <li>4 carrots, halved</li>
        <li>4 stalks celery, halved</li>
        <li>1 large onion, halved</li>
        <li>water to cover</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chicken bouillon granules</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Place chicken, carrots, celery, and onion in a large soup pot; add enough cold water to cover. Bring to a boil over medium heat; reduce heat to low and simmer, uncovered, until meat falls off of the bone, about 90 minutes. Skim off foam every so often, as needed.

        </li>
        <li>Remove chicken from the pot and let sit until cool enough to handle; chop meat into pieces, and discard skin and bones.</li>
        <li>Strain out vegetables, reserving the stock; rinse the soup pot and return the stock to the pot. Chop vegetables into smaller pieces; return chopped chicken and vegetables to the pot.

        </li>
        <li>Warm soup until heated through; season with salt, pepper, and chicken bouillon to taste.</li>
    </ol>
