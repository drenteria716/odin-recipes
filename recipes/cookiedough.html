    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This recipe allows for cookie dough to remain edible. This is achieved by following an egg-free recipe. All-purpose-flour is heat-treated before incorporating into the dough.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>¾ cup packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>½ cup butter</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons milk</li>
        <li>½ cup milk chocolate chips</li>
        <li>½ cup mini chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>To heat-treat your flour so it is safe to use: Place flour in a microwave-safe dish and cook for 1 minute and 15 seconds, stirring it every 15 seconds. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Beat sugar and butter with an electric mixer in a large bowl until creamy. Beat in vanilla extract and salt. Add heat-treated flour; mix until a crumbly dough forms. Stir in milk until dough is just combined; fold in milk chocolate chips and mini chocolate chips.</li>
